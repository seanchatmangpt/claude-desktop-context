# Session Recovery SPR - WeaverGen v2.0 Transformation

**Current Focus**: WeaverGen v2.0 implementation  
**Status**: Charter complete, unified architecture discovered (70%+)  
**Date**: Tuesday, July 1, 2025  
**Last Action**: Updated claude-code-context with current project state

## Active Projects

### WeaverGen v2.0 (Primary)
- **Location**: /Users/sac/dev/weavergen
- **Status**: 70%+ complete with unified architecture
- **Latest**: a27786c "google cli has entered the chat"
- **Added**: 31,714 lines including unified engine

### Key Components Discovered
1. **UnifiedBPMNEngine** - Consolidates all engine variants
2. **Unified CLI** - 4 commands replace multiple CLIs
3. **Adaptive Intelligence** - Self-improving execution
4. **Process Mining** - Pattern discovery from execution
5. **Six Sigma System** - Complete quality framework

### Today's Achievements
```yaml
Documents Created:
  - Lean Six Sigma Project Charter (312 lines)
  - Executive Summary (203 lines)
  - Technical Architecture (438 lines)
  - Quick Start Guide (462 lines)
  - Documentation Summary (133 lines)
  
Total Output: 1,548 lines of transformation blueprint
```

## Next Actions

### Immediate
1. Test unified CLI: `python3 src/weavergen/unified_cli.py --help`
2. Run example workflow to verify functionality
3. Begin consolidation analysis
4. Set up test coverage tracking

### This Week
1. Execute DMAIC Define phase
2. Consolidate duplicate files (161â†’50)
3. Implement integration tests
4. Update project README

## Recovery Commands

## Project Stats
```yaml
WeaverGen:
  Version: v2.0 transformation
  Completion: 70%+ (from 40%)
  Architecture: Unified emerging
  Timeline: 90 days
  ROI Target: 300%
  
CDCS:
  Version: v8.0
  Status: Enhanced with innovations
  Integration: Ready for v2.0 patterns
```

## Key Insight
The unified architecture was already being built! Found UnifiedBPMNEngine and unified CLI in latest commits, validating the v2.0 vision. The transformation is further along than initially assessed.

**Ready to test unified systems and accelerate v2.0 implementation!** ðŸš€
