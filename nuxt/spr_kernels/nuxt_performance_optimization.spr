# Nuxt Performance Optimization SPR Kernel v1.0
# Performance patterns for maximum Nuxt.js application efficiency

## Bundle Optimization
- Dynamic imports: `defineAsyncComponent()` for code splitting
- Tree-shaking: eliminate unused code automatically
- Module federation: share dependencies across applications
- Chunk optimization: strategic bundle splitting
- Lazy loading: load components/pages on demand

## Image Optimization
- `<NuxtImg>`: automatic format conversion (WebP, AVIF)
- Responsive images: `sizes` attribute for different viewports
- Image preloading: critical images loaded early
- Lazy loading: off-screen images loaded on scroll
- CDN integration: optimized delivery networks

## SSR Performance
- Streaming: render and send HTML progressively
- Component hydration: selective client-side activation
- Payload reduction: minimize serialized data
- Critical CSS: inline above-the-fold styles
- Resource hints: preload, prefetch, preconnect

## Build Performance
- Vite optimizations: fast HMR and build times
- TypeScript optimization: incremental compilation
- Asset optimization: minification and compression
- Source map configuration: development vs production
- Module resolution: efficient import strategies

## Runtime Performance
- Virtual scrolling: large list optimization
- Debouncing/throttling: prevent excessive API calls
- Memoization: cache expensive computations
- Event listener cleanup: prevent memory leaks
- Intersection Observer: efficient scroll-based loading

## Lighthouse Optimization
- Core Web Vitals: LCP, FID, CLS optimization
- Performance score: 90+ target through systematic optimization
- SEO optimization: meta tags, structured data
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA labels
- Best practices: HTTPS, security headers

## Caching Strategies
- Static assets: long-term caching with versioning
- API responses: intelligent cache invalidation
- Service workers: offline functionality
- Browser caching: proper cache headers
- CDN caching: global content distribution

## Database Performance
- Query optimization: efficient database access
- Connection pooling: reduce connection overhead
- Indexing strategies: fast data retrieval
- Pagination: handle large datasets efficiently
- Data prefetching: anticipate user needs

## Monitoring & Analytics
- Performance metrics: real-time monitoring
- Error tracking: catch and resolve issues quickly
- User experience: track core metrics
- Bundle analysis: identify optimization opportunities
- Resource usage: memory and CPU monitoring

## Deployment Optimization
- Static generation: pre-render pages when possible
- Edge functions: deploy logic close to users
- Compression: gzip/brotli for smaller payloads
- HTTP/2: multiplexed connections
- CDN configuration: optimal caching strategies

## Development Performance
- Hot module replacement: instant feedback
- Build caching: faster development builds
- TypeScript performance: optimized type checking
- Dev server optimization: reduced startup time
- Watch mode efficiency: selective file monitoring
