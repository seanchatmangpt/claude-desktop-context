          ## ðŸ“Š Test Coverage Report
          
          The coverage validation has completed. Please check that:
          
          - âœ… **Unit tests**: Should comprise ~80% of test suite
          - âœ… **Integration tests**: Should comprise ~20% of test suite  
          - âœ… **Line coverage**: Should be â‰¥80%
          - âœ… **Function coverage**: Should be â‰¥80%
          - âœ… **Branch coverage**: Should be â‰¥70%
          
          **CDCS Enhanced Testing Strategy:**
          - Unit tests focus on SPR functions, prediction algorithms, and pattern extraction
          - Integration tests cover auto-predict, auto-optimize, and development loop workflows
          - E2E tests validate complete CDCS system functionality
          
          See the full coverage report in the job artifacts.
