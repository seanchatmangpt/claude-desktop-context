Feature: SPR Kernel Activation System
  As a Nuxt developer using CDCS v3.1.0
  I want to activate SPR kernels for optimal development patterns
  So that I can achieve 95% token efficiency and accelerated development

  Background:
    Given a Nuxt project with CDCS v3.1.0 installed
    And SPR kernels are available in the spr_kernels directory
    And the project has 8 specialized Nuxt SPR kernels

  Scenario: Activate component architecture SPR kernel
    Given I have components with shared logic patterns
    When I run "npm run spr:activate component_architecture"
    Then the nuxt_component_architecture.spr kernel should be loaded
    And I should see component patterns activated
    And token efficiency should improve by 20-30%
    And the system should detect composable extraction opportunities

  Scenario: Activate API patterns SPR kernel
    Given I have server/api routes in my project
    When I run "npm run spr:activate api_patterns"
    Then the nuxt_api_patterns.spr kernel should be loaded
    And API route patterns should be recognized
    And middleware recommendations should be provided
    And authentication patterns should be suggested

  Scenario: Activate SSR hydration SPR kernel
    Given I have SSR-enabled pages with potential hydration issues
    When I run "npm run spr:activate ssr_hydration"
    Then the nuxt_ssr_hydration.spr kernel should be loaded
    And hydration mismatch risks should be detected
    And ClientOnly component suggestions should be provided
    And SSR-safe patterns should be recommended

  Scenario: Activate performance optimization SPR kernel
    Given my bundle size exceeds 250KB
    When I run "npm run spr:activate performance_optimization"
    Then the nuxt_performance_optimization.spr kernel should be loaded
    And lazy loading opportunities should be identified
    And image optimization suggestions should be provided
    And bundle splitting recommendations should be generated

  Scenario: Activate multiple SPR kernels for comprehensive optimization
    Given I want to optimize my entire Nuxt application
    When I run "npm run auto:focus"
    Then the system should analyze my project structure
    And activate the most relevant SPR kernels automatically
    And provide a prioritized optimization plan
    And achieve 80%+ token efficiency across all operations

  Scenario: SPR kernel provides contextual recommendations
    Given I have an activated SPR kernel
    When I'm working on related code patterns
    Then the system should provide contextual suggestions
    And predict my next development needs with 85%+ accuracy
    And offer automated pattern application
    And reduce context switching by 60%

  Scenario: Validate SPR kernel effectiveness
    Given I have activated SPR kernels
    When I run "npm run spr:validate"
    Then the system should measure token efficiency gains
    And report pattern detection accuracy
    And show development velocity improvements
    And validate that efficiency targets are met
