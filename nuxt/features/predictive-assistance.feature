Feature: Predictive Development Assistance
  As a Nuxt developer using CDCS
  I want predictive assistance for my development workflow
  So that I can work more efficiently and avoid common pitfalls

  Background:
    Given a Nuxt project with development activity
    And the CDCS prediction system is active
    And development patterns are being tracked

  Scenario: Predict component development needs
    Given I have been actively developing components
    And I have 3+ components with similar patterns
    When I run "npm run cdcs:predict"
    Then the system should predict composable extraction needs
    And suggest shared component patterns
    And recommend component architecture improvements
    And provide automated refactoring suggestions

  Scenario: Predict API development needs
    Given I have API routes without middleware
    And I'm actively developing server endpoints
    When the prediction system analyzes my project
    Then it should predict authentication middleware needs
    And suggest validation pattern implementation
    And recommend error handling strategies
    And predict scaling requirements

  Scenario: Predict performance optimization needs
    Given my bundle size is growing
    And I have high development activity
    When the performance predictor runs
    Then it should predict bundle size issues
    And suggest lazy loading implementations
    And recommend code splitting strategies
    And predict performance bottlenecks

  Scenario: Predict SEO optimization needs
    Given I have pages without proper meta tags
    When the SEO predictor analyzes my pages
    Then it should predict meta tag requirements
    And suggest Open Graph implementation
    And recommend structured data additions
    And predict SEO performance issues

  Scenario: Enhanced prediction with Nuxt core team insights
    Given I want comprehensive development predictions
    When I run "npm run cdcs:nuxt-core-analyze"
    Then the system should apply Nuxt core team patterns
    And identify 80% real-world use case gaps
    And predict hydration issues before they occur
    And suggest module optimization strategies
    And provide business impact assessments

  Scenario: Auto-predict workflow integration
    Given I want seamless predictive assistance
    When I run "npm run auto:predict"
    Then the system should analyze my current context
    And predict my next development needs
    And automatically activate relevant SPR kernels
    And provide actionable next steps
    And integrate with my development workflow

  Scenario: Confidence-based prediction filtering
    Given the system has generated multiple predictions
    When I request filtered predictions
    Then high-confidence predictions should be prioritized
    And business impact should influence ranking
    And time estimates should be provided
    And implementation complexity should be considered
    And ROI should be calculated for each suggestion
