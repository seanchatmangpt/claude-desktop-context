Feature: 80/20 Test Coverage Validation
  As a Nuxt developer using CDCS
  I want automated test coverage validation following the 80/20 rule
  So that I can maintain high code quality with efficient testing

  Background:
    Given a Nuxt project with CDCS test infrastructure
    And 80/20 test coverage rules are configured
    And vitest is set up with coverage validation

  Scenario: Validate 80% unit test coverage
    Given I have unit tests for core functionality
    When I run "npm run test:coverage"
    Then the system should enforce 80% unit test coverage
    And validate SPR activation functionality
    And test pattern detection accuracy
    And verify prediction system reliability
    And ensure performance benchmarking correctness

  Scenario: Validate 20% integration test coverage
    Given I have integration tests for workflows
    When I run "npm run test:integration"
    Then the system should validate workflow integration
    And test end-to-end autonomous processes
    And verify SPR kernel interactions
    And validate real-world usage scenarios
    And ensure system reliability under load

  Scenario: Automated coverage validation
    Given I want to enforce coverage requirements
    When I run "npm run test:validate-coverage"
    Then the system should run all tests with coverage
    And validate 80/20 coverage distribution
    And fail if coverage thresholds are not met
    And provide detailed coverage reports
    And suggest areas needing more tests

  Scenario: Coverage validation in CI/CD
    Given I have continuous integration set up
    When the CI pipeline runs tests
    Then coverage validation should be enforced
    And builds should fail on insufficient coverage
    And coverage reports should be generated
    And coverage trends should be tracked
    And regressions should be prevented

  Scenario: Test quality validation
    Given I want high-quality test coverage
    When I run comprehensive test validation
    Then the system should validate test effectiveness
    And ensure tests cover critical user paths
    And verify edge case handling
    And validate error condition testing
    And ensure performance regression testing

  Scenario: SPR system test coverage
    Given the SPR system is core functionality
    When I validate SPR test coverage
    Then all SPR activation scenarios should be tested
    And kernel loading mechanisms should be validated
    And pattern recognition should be thoroughly tested
    And efficiency calculations should be verified
    And error handling should be comprehensively tested

  Scenario: Real-world scenario testing
    Given I want tests that reflect actual usage
    When I run scenario-based tests
    Then the tests should simulate real development workflows
    And validate common developer use cases
    And test integration with Nuxt ecosystem
    And verify performance under realistic conditions
    And ensure compatibility with Nuxt updates

  Scenario: Coverage reporting and insights
    Given I want actionable coverage insights
    When I generate coverage reports
    Then the system should provide detailed metrics
    And highlight uncovered critical paths
    And suggest test improvement strategies
    And track coverage trends over time
    And provide ROI analysis for testing efforts
