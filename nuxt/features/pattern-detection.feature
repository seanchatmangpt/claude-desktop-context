Feature: Nuxt Pattern Detection and Analysis
  As a Nuxt developer using CDCS
  I want intelligent pattern detection across my codebase
  So that I can identify optimization opportunities and maintain code quality

  Background:
    Given a Nuxt project with various components, pages, and API routes
    And the CDCS pattern detection system is active
    And I have the nuxt-pattern-analyzer script available

  Scenario: Detect component architecture patterns
    Given I have Vue components with shared logic
    When I run "npm run patterns:extract"
    Then the system should identify repeated prop definitions
    And detect composable extraction opportunities
    And find computed property patterns
    And suggest component architecture improvements
    And report component reusability metrics

  Scenario: Analyze API route patterns
    Given I have multiple API routes in server/api
    When the pattern analyzer scans my API routes
    Then it should detect authentication patterns
    And identify database query patterns
    And find error handling inconsistencies
    And suggest middleware extraction opportunities
    And recommend validation patterns

  Scenario: Detect SSR and hydration patterns
    Given I have pages with client-side specific code
    When the SSR pattern analyzer runs
    Then it should identify hydration mismatch risks
    And detect browser-specific API usage
    And find localStorage/sessionStorage usage
    And suggest ClientOnly component usage
    And report SSR compatibility score

  Scenario: Identify performance optimization patterns
    Given my application has performance bottlenecks
    When I run performance pattern detection
    Then the system should find large bundle components
    And identify missing lazy loading opportunities
    And detect unoptimized image usage
    And suggest code splitting points
    And recommend caching strategies

  Scenario: Analyze module usage patterns
    Given I have multiple Nuxt modules installed
    When the module analyzer runs
    Then it should detect unused modules
    And identify module configuration conflicts
    And suggest module consolidation opportunities
    And report module bundle impact
    And recommend module optimization strategies

  Scenario: Detect auto-import optimization patterns
    Given I have many composables and utilities
    When the auto-import analyzer runs
    Then it should identify naming conflicts
    And detect unused auto-imports
    And find explicit import opportunities
    And suggest auto-import optimization
    And report import efficiency metrics

  Scenario: Generate recurring pattern report
    Given I have analyzed multiple files
    When I request a recurring pattern report
    Then the system should identify cross-file patterns
    And calculate pattern frequency scores
    And suggest pattern standardization
    And provide refactoring recommendations
    And generate pattern evolution insights
