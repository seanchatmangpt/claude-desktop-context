Feature: Token Efficiency Optimization
  As a Nuxt developer using CDCS v3.1.0
  I want maximum token efficiency through SPR kernels
  So that I can achieve 95% token efficiency and faster context processing

  Background:
    Given a Nuxt project with CDCS token optimization
    And SPR kernels are designed for maximum efficiency
    And token usage is monitored and optimized

  Scenario: Achieve 95% token efficiency target
    Given I have SPR kernels activated
    When the system processes development contexts
    Then token efficiency should reach 95%
    And context loading should be 20x faster than file reading
    And memory usage should be optimized
    And response times should be under 100ms
    And token reduction should exceed 90%

  Scenario: SPR kernel compression effectiveness
    Given I have 2.5KB SPR kernels
    When they activate 50KB+ context equivalent
    Then compression ratio should exceed 20:1
    And activation should preserve semantic fidelity
    And context accuracy should remain above 94%
    And knowledge activation should be instantaneous
    And pattern matching should be highly precise

  Scenario: Latent space priming optimization
    Given I'm using latent space priming techniques
    When SPR kernels are activated
    Then semantic similarity threshold should be 0.7+
    And latent compression ratio should be 0.1 (90% reduction)
    And priming effectiveness should be measured
    And context coherence should be maintained
    And activation speed should be optimized

  Scenario: Token allocation optimization
    Given I have 200k token context window
    When the system allocates tokens efficiently
    Then 30k tokens should be allocated for conversation
    And 10k tokens for SPR kernels
    And 50k tokens for file operations
    And 110k tokens for dynamic context
    And allocation should adapt based on usage patterns

  Scenario: Real-time token efficiency monitoring
    Given I want to track token efficiency
    When I run development workflows
    Then the system should monitor token usage in real-time
    And report efficiency metrics continuously
    And alert on efficiency degradation
    And suggest optimization opportunities
    And maintain efficiency above target thresholds

  Scenario: SPR-first context loading strategy
    Given I need context for development tasks
    When the system loads development context
    Then it should check SPR kernels first
    And only read files when SPR coverage is insufficient
    And prioritize high-efficiency knowledge activation
    And minimize redundant file reading
    And optimize context relevance and precision

  Scenario: Adaptive token efficiency optimization
    Given the system learns from usage patterns
    When token efficiency is being optimized
    Then the system should adapt SPR activation strategies
    And optimize kernel selection algorithms
    And improve compression effectiveness over time
    And personalize efficiency strategies
    And maintain consistent high performance

  Scenario: Token efficiency validation and reporting
    Given I want to validate efficiency gains
    When I run token efficiency analysis
    Then the system should measure actual vs target efficiency
    And report token savings achieved
    And validate performance improvements
    And provide efficiency trend analysis
    And recommend further optimization strategies
