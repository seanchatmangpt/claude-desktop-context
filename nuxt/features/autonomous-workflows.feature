Feature: Autonomous Development Workflows
  As a Nuxt developer using CDCS
  I want autonomous workflows that optimize my development process
  So that I can focus on building features while the system handles optimization

  Background:
    Given a Nuxt project with CDCS autonomous capabilities
    And workflow automation scripts are available
    And the system can make intelligent development decisions

  Scenario: Auto-focus workflow for context optimization
    Given I want to optimize my development context
    When I run "npm run auto:focus"
    Then the system should analyze my current project state
    And predict my immediate development needs
    And activate relevant SPR kernels automatically
    And prepare my development environment optimally
    And reduce context switching time by 60%

  Scenario: Auto-optimize workflow for performance
    Given I want to optimize my application performance
    When I run "npm run auto:optimize"
    Then the system should run performance optimizations
    And execute build process with optimizations
    And run performance benchmarks
    And apply automated performance improvements
    And validate optimization effectiveness

  Scenario: Auto-improve workflow for continuous enhancement
    Given I want continuous improvement of my codebase
    When I run "npm run auto:improve"
    Then the system should benchmark current performance
    And evolve SPR kernels based on usage patterns
    And validate improvements automatically
    And apply successful optimizations
    And track improvement metrics over time

  Scenario: Auto-predict workflow for proactive assistance
    Given I want proactive development assistance
    When I run "npm run auto:predict"
    Then the system should analyze my development patterns
    And predict my next development needs
    And automatically activate component_architecture SPR
    And prepare relevant development contexts
    And provide predictive guidance

  Scenario: Development loop automation
    Given I want automated development optimization
    When I run "npm run loop:development"
    Then the system should continuously monitor my development
    And automatically apply optimizations
    And predict and prevent common issues
    And maintain optimal development velocity
    And provide real-time development insights

  Scenario: Validation loop automation
    Given I want automated quality assurance
    When I run "npm run loop:validation"
    Then the system should run comprehensive test coverage
    And execute integration tests automatically
    And validate code quality continuously
    And ensure 80/20 test coverage is maintained
    And alert on quality regressions

  Scenario: Continuous improvement loop
    Given I want ongoing system optimization
    When I run "npm run loop:continuous"
    Then the system should monitor all performance metrics
    And automatically evolve based on usage patterns
    And apply machine learning for pattern optimization
    And maintain system efficiency above 95%
    And provide periodic optimization reports

  Scenario: Intelligent workflow adaptation
    Given the system learns from my development patterns
    When I use autonomous workflows regularly
    Then the system should adapt to my coding style
    And personalize optimization strategies
    And predict my preferences accurately
    And reduce manual intervention needs
    And increase development velocity by 40%
