    And see hydration debugging strategies
    And access production SSR optimization techniques

  Scenario: Module ecosystem optimization
    Given I'm using multiple Nuxt modules
    When I activate the nuxt_modules_ecosystem SPR kernel
    Then I should see 80% module usage patterns
    And get module conflict resolution strategies
    And receive performance impact assessments
    And see module tree-shaking opportunities
    And access module configuration best practices

  Scenario: Auto-imports optimization patterns
    Given I have complex auto-import usage
    When I activate the nuxt_autoimports_optimization SPR kernel
    Then I should get conflict resolution strategies
    And see naming convention recommendations
    And receive explicit import optimization suggestions
    And get auto-import performance insights
    And access composable organization patterns

  Scenario: SEO meta optimization patterns
    Given I need production-ready SEO implementation
    When I activate the nuxt_seo_meta SPR kernel
    Then I should get Open Graph implementation patterns
    And see structured data integration strategies
    And receive dynamic meta tag patterns
    And get SEO performance optimization techniques
    And access social media optimization patterns

  Scenario: DevTools integration for enhanced DX
    Given I want enhanced development experience
    When I activate the nuxt_devtools_integration SPR kernel

    And receive debugging workflow optimizations
    And get development metric tracking patterns
    And access DevTools customization strategies

  Scenario: Component architecture patterns
    Given I'm building complex component structures
    When I activate the nuxt_component_architecture SPR kernel
    Then I should get file-based routing patterns
    And see component composition strategies
    And receive state management integration patterns
    And get prop drilling avoidance techniques
    And access component testing patterns

  Scenario: API patterns for robust backends
    Given I'm developing API routes and middleware
    When I activate the nuxt_api_patterns SPR kernel
    Then I should get authentication pattern implementations
    And see validation and error handling strategies
    And receive database integration patterns
    And get API versioning and caching techniques
    And access middleware composition patterns

  Scenario: Performance optimization strategies
    Given I need production-level performance

    Then I should get bundle optimization strategies
    And see lazy loading implementation patterns
    And receive image optimization techniques
    And get code splitting best practices
    And access caching strategy implementations

  Scenario: Core team analysis and recommendations
    Given I want comprehensive Nuxt optimization
    When I run "npm run cdcs:nuxt-core-analyze"
    Then the system should apply core team insights
    And identify critical production issues
    And provide business impact assessments
    And suggest implementation priorities
    And give time estimates for improvements
