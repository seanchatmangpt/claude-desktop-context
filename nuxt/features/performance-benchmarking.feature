Feature: Performance Benchmarking and Optimization
  As a Nuxt developer using CDCS
  I want comprehensive performance benchmarking
  So that I can measure and optimize my application's performance

  Background:
    Given a Nuxt project with CDCS v3.1.0
    And performance benchmarking tools are available
    And performance targets are defined in package.json

  Scenario: Measure build performance
    Given I want to benchmark my build process
    When I run "npm run benchmark:nuxt"
    Then the system should measure build time
    And report if build time is under 30 seconds
    And analyze build output size
    And identify build performance bottlenecks
    And provide build optimization recommendations

  Scenario: Analyze bundle size and composition
    Given my application bundle needs analysis
    When the bundle analyzer runs
    Then it should measure total bundle size
    And separate client and server bundle sizes
    And identify largest dependencies
    And suggest bundle optimization strategies
    And validate bundle size is under 250KB target

  Scenario: Measure SPR efficiency gains
    Given I have SPR kernels activated
    When I run SPR efficiency measurement
    Then the system should calculate token reduction
    And measure context activation efficiency
    And report compression ratios
    And validate 95% token efficiency target
    And show SPR vs file reading comparisons

  Scenario: Lighthouse performance audit
    Given I want comprehensive performance metrics
    When I run "npm run benchmark:lighthouse"
    Then the system should measure performance score
    And evaluate accessibility metrics
    And assess SEO optimization
    And check best practices compliance
    And target 95+ Lighthouse performance score

  Scenario: API performance benchmarking
    Given I have API routes to benchmark
    When the API performance analyzer runs
    Then it should measure API response times
    And validate response times under 100ms
    And identify slow API endpoints
    And suggest API optimization strategies
    And recommend caching implementations

  Scenario: Real-time performance monitoring
    Given I want continuous performance tracking
    When I run "npm run loop:continuous"
    Then the system should monitor performance metrics
    And alert on performance regressions
    And track performance trends over time
    And suggest proactive optimizations
    And maintain performance target compliance

  Scenario: Performance rating and recommendations
    Given performance benchmarks are complete
    When the system calculates performance rating
    Then it should provide a star rating (1-5 stars)
    And generate specific improvement recommendations
    And prioritize optimizations by impact
    And provide implementation time estimates
    And calculate potential performance gains

  Scenario: Comprehensive performance report
    Given I want a complete performance overview
    When I generate a performance report
    Then it should include all benchmark results
    And show performance trends
    And highlight critical issues
    And provide actionable next steps
    And save results for comparison tracking
