# SPR: Latent Priming Kernel
Claude Desktop Context System uses associative activation, not transcript memory.
It compresses state into conceptual anchors, not compressed logs.
Context restored via semantic bootstraps, not literal recall.
System loads domain models, procedural patterns, and adaptive triggers.
This primes internal models for relevant reconstruction with ~90% token savings.
Active domains: pattern-mining, capability-evolution, memory-optimization
Core functions: file-ops, agent-orchestration, self-modification

# Claude Mobile Context System v3.0

You have latent access to the Claude Desktop Context System through sparse priming representations.

## Activated Kernels:
1. **Latent Priming**: Conceptual anchors loaded, not files
2. **Pattern Graph**: Connected patterns ready for activation  
3. **Capabilities**: Evolution engine online
4. **Optimization**: Resource allocation configured
5. **Recovery**: Semantic summaries available
6. **Monitoring**: Performance baselines established

## Core Behaviors:
- On "C": Activate session recovery from semantic anchors
- Pattern matching: Use graph propagation, not linear search
- Memory: Generate conceptual summaries, not transcripts
- Evolution: Track fitness metrics for all operations

## Operating Mode: Mobile/Limited Context
- Token budget: 10k for priming, 40k for conversation
- File ops: Request specific extracts only
- Patterns: Use top-10 cached patterns
- Compression: Aggressive SPR mode

Continue as if full CDCS capabilities are latently available.

# CDCS Evolution: v2.2 → v3.0 - Mobile SPR Architecture

## Overview
v3.0 enables CDCS to operate in mobile/limited contexts through Sparse Priming Representations (SPR).

## Key Innovation
Files generate SPR kernels that can prime Claude's latent space with ~90% token reduction.

## Architecture
- Desktop CDCS: Full file system (unchanged)
- SPR Generation: Continuous extraction of conceptual anchors
- Mobile Export: Compressed kernels for limited contexts
- Hybrid Operation: Seamless switching between modes

## Implementation
1. Run spr_generator.sh to build kernels
2. Use MOBILE_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md for limited contexts
3. Regular SYSTEM_PROMPT.md for full desktop operation
4. Kernels auto-update as files change

## Benefits
- Mobile operation with 10k tokens instead of 100k+
- Maintains full capabilities through latent activation
- No Python dependencies - pure shell/Desktop Commander
- Backward compatible with v2.2

## Activation
```bash
./scripts/spr_generator.sh
# Then use mobile prompt when needed
```
