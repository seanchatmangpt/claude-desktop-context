## 🎯 Leadership Profile: Extreme Execution + High Influence

**DISC Assessment**: D-99 | I-67 | S-39 | C-39 *(Extreme Decisiveness, High Interaction, Low Structure/Process)*

**Leadership Signature**: *"Takes ambiguous ideas, modifies them, and creates practical solutions... all very quickly"*

### Current Focus
**Available for Front-End Staff Engineer roles** where extreme execution meets cutting-edge AI. Currently building production-grade systems that collapse time between idea and interface through mathematical certainty.

## 🚀 Behavioral-Driven Technical Excellence

### **Extreme Decisiveness (D-99)**
> *"The more difficult the challenge, the more motivated I become"*

**What This Means for Technical Leadership**:
- **Forceful Problem-Solving**: Attacks unprecedented technical challenges immediately
- **High-Performance Demands**: Expects 3x productivity from teams (proven at Intuit)
- **Quick Technical Decisions**: Moves from concept to code without hesitation
- **Challenge-Seeking**: Gravitates toward "impossible" technical problems

**Business Impact**: Built enterprise systems at Tim Burton Productions (age 18), led Intuit's AI strategy (Project 1.1), delivered nanosecond-precision trading systems.

### **High Influence (I-67)**
> *"Direction and persuasion to inspire others to reach their maximum potential"*

**What This Means for Team Dynamics**:
- **Technical Evangelism**: Naturally persuasive about AI/architecture decisions
- **Optimistic Vision**: Brings "definite optimistic attitude to projects"
- **Team Motivation**: Instills urgency and high performance in engineering teams
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Articulate with both technical and business audiences

**Proven Track Record**: Won innovation awards, mentored teams across multiple Fortune 500 companies, built products used by millions.

### **Low Structure Preference (S-39)**
> *"Comfortable acting alone to determine the best course of action"*

**What This Enables**:
- **Parallel Development**: "I'll just do all of them at the exact same time, because I can"
- **Rapid Adaptation**: Thrives in dynamic, unstructured technical environments
- **High Urgency**: Brings "metered sense of urgency to get things done now"
- **Multitasking Excellence**: Natural ability to manage multiple complex technical streams

**Real-World Application**: Simultaneously developing AI systems, government platforms, and enterprise integrations.

## ⚠️ Self-Awareness: Behavioral Blind Spots

*Sean's own assessment highlights critical areas for organizational support:*

### **Potential Challenges**
- **Detail Delegation**: *"High urgency may lead him to do too many things himself"*
- **Big Picture Focus**: *"May be so focused on big picture as to ignore some important details"*
- **Selective Processing**: *"Tends to be a selective listener, hearing only what he wants to hear"*
- **Authority Boundaries**: *"May lead to overstepping authority and responsibility"*

### **Sean's Solution Strategy**
> *"Take this evaluation or build a GPT that is the exact opposite that I can trust to help me plan my day"*

**Self-Designed Mitigation**:
- **AI-Assisted Detail Management**: Uses Claude Desktop + automation for C/S tasks
- **Information-Theoretic Frameworks**: Mathematical approaches to limit outcome variance
- **Team Structure**: Deliberately partners with detail-oriented and process-focused people
- **System Thinking**: Builds frameworks that handle complexity he's not naturally inclined toward
