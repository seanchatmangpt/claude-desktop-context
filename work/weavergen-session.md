PROJECT: WeaverGen - Python wrapper for OTel Weaver Forge
LOCATION: /Users/sac/dev/weavergen
STATUS: Initialized and ready for implementation
FOCUS: OpenTelemetry semantic convention automation with Claude Code optimization

## Project Context
- **Core Purpose**: Transform YAML semantic conventions → multi-language code
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11+, OTel Weaver Forge (Rust), Jinja2, Typer
- **Performance Target**: 26x optimization with CDCS v8.0 compound intelligence
- **Integration**: Claude Code custom commands + agent workflows

## Current State
✅ Project structure complete with modern Python tooling
✅ CLI interface implemented with Typer + Rich
✅ Core models defined with Pydantic validation
✅ Test framework configured with pytest + coverage
✅ Documentation comprehensive with usage examples
✅ CDCS v8.0 integration configured
✅ Makefile with compound automation workflows

## Next Actions
1. Install OTel Weaver binary (cargo install otellib-weaver-cli)
2. Implement core WeaverGen integration with subprocess handling
3. Add template system for multi-language code generation
4. Create Claude Code custom commands (/otel:generate, /otel:validate)
5. Performance benchmarking to achieve 26x target

## Compound Impact
- **Input**: 20 hours development investment
- **Output**: Revolutionary OpenTelemetry development acceleration  
- **Multiplier**: Every semantic convention → instant multi-language SDK
- **Ecosystem**: Transform telemetry instrumentation development
