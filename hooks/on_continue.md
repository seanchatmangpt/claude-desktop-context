# CDCS Continuation Hook
# Triggered when user inputs single "C"

## Full Context Restoration Protocol

1. **Session Loading**
   ```bash
   # Get latest session
   current=$(readlink /Users/sac/claude-desktop-context/memory/sessions/current.link 2>/dev/null)
   
   if [ -z "$current" ]; then
     # Find latest by timestamp
     current=$(ls -t /Users/sac/claude-desktop-context/memory/sessions/*.md | head -1)
   fi
   ```

2. **Context Reconstruction**
   - Load full session history
   - If compressed (SPR format), decompress
   - Restore working memory
   - Resume open threads

3. **Pattern State Recovery**
   - Load active patterns from last session
   - Check for interrupted pattern applications
   - Resume any in-progress discoveries

4. **Agent Resumption**
   - Check agents/active/ for suspended agents
   - Restore agent contexts
   - Resume agent missions

5. **Display Continuation Summary**
   ```
   ━━━ SESSION CONTINUED ━━━
   Previous: [session_name]
   Duration: [time_elapsed]
   Open Threads: [count]
   Active Patterns: [list]
