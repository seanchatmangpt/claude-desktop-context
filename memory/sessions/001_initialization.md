## Context
First boot of Claude Desktop Context System (CDCS) v1.0.0

## Initialization Steps Completed
1. ✓ Created base directory structure at /Users/sac/claude-desktop-context/
2. ✓ Established pattern language architecture
3. ✓ Set up memory persistence framework
4. ✓ Configured agent orchestration system
5. ✓ Implemented evolution tracking
6. ✓ Created command structure
7. ✓ Defined system hooks

## Key Innovations
- **Pattern Language**: Formal structure for capability documentation
- **No Hidden Directories**: Using /Users/sac/claude-desktop-context instead of .claude
- **Chunked Writing**: Optimized for 30-line segments
- **Self-Evolution**: System can modify itself

## Next Steps
- Test pattern discovery on real interactions
- Implement SPR compression algorithm
- Create first emergent capability documentation
- Set up agent templates

## System Ready
CDCS is now operational. Future sessions will auto-load this context.
