# CDCS Evolution: v2.2 â†’ v3.0 - Mobile SPR Architecture

## Overview
v3.0 enables CDCS to operate in mobile/limited contexts through Sparse Priming Representations (SPR).

## Key Innovation
Files generate SPR kernels that can prime Claude's latent space with ~90% token reduction.

## Architecture
- Desktop CDCS: Full file system (unchanged)
- SPR Generation: Continuous extraction of conceptual anchors
- Mobile Export: Compressed kernels for limited contexts
- Hybrid Operation: Seamless switching between modes

## Implementation
1. Run spr_generator.sh to build kernels
2. Use MOBILE_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md for limited contexts
3. Regular SYSTEM_PROMPT.md for full desktop operation
4. Kernels auto-update as files change

## Benefits
- Mobile operation with 10k tokens instead of 100k+
- Maintains full capabilities through latent activation
- No Python dependencies - pure shell/Desktop Commander
- Backward compatible with v2.2

## Activation
```bash
./scripts/spr_generator.sh
# Then use mobile prompt when needed
```
