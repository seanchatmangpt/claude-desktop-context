# WeaverGen Claude-Code-Context Update

**Date**: Monday, June 30, 2025  
**Action**: Updated CCCS context based on uncommitted changes review

## What Was Updated

1. **session_recovery.spr**
   - Updated to reflect 4-layer architecture implementation
   - Documented 15+ new files and 643+ lines of changes
   - Raised completion estimate to ~40%

2. **current_status.md** (new file)
   - Detailed breakdown of uncommitted changes
   - Strategic recommendations for commits
   - Testing commands for validation

3. **README.md**
   - Added prominent uncommitted changes warning
   - Updated architecture diagram to show 4-layer design
   - Included test commands for new CLI
   - Added commit strategy options

## Key Findings

The WeaverGen project has undergone a major architectural evolution that hasn't been committed:

- **4-Layer Clean Architecture**: Fully implemented in `src/weavergen/layers/`
- **Enhanced CLI**: Expanded from ~50 to 672+ lines with 6+ new commands
- **Multi-Agent Integration**: Ollama-based agent system added
- **OTEL Validation**: Comprehensive span validation architecture

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test the new CLI** to ensure functionality
2. **Commit to feature branch** for safety
3. **Update main project README** after testing
4. **Finally install Weaver binary** (still the main blocker)

The project is more mature than previously assessed, but needs these changes committed and tested.
