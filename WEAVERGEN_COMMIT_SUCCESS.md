### Major Components Added

1. **4-Layer Architecture** (`src/weavergen/layers/`)
   - Complete implementation of clean architecture
   - Commands, Operations, Runtime, Contracts layers
   - OTEL validation and span gap analysis

2. **Enhanced CLI** (`src/weavergen/cli.py`)
   - Expanded from basic to 672+ lines
   - 6+ new commands with rich Typer interface
   - Professional error handling and progress indicators

3. **Multi-Agent System** (`src/weavergen/agents/`)
   - Ollama-based multi-agent orchestration
   - Agent conversation flow management
   - Integration with Pydantic AI

4. **Test Generated System** (`test_generated/`)
   - Complete generated system example
   - Demonstrates end-to-end pipeline potential
   - Includes agents, CLI, OTEL instrumentation

5. **Architecture Documentation**
   - FOUR_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md
   - OTEL_SPAN_ARCHITECTURE_VALIDATION.md
   - agent_conversation_flow.md

## Impact

This commit represents a **major architectural evolution** that:
- Provides solid foundation for semantic → code generation
- Implements professional-grade CLI interface
- Adds multi-agent orchestration capabilities
- Creates clear separation of concerns
- Enables better testing and maintenance

## Next Steps

1. **Install Weaver Binary** (still the main blocker)
   ```bash
   # Research installation method
   # Weaver is needed to process semantic conventions
   ```

2. **Test New Architecture**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sac/dev/weavergen
   python -m weavergen --help
   python -m weavergen status
   python -m weavergen.layers.demo
   ```

3. **Update Main README**
   - Document new CLI commands
   - Add architecture overview
   - Update completion percentage to 40%

4. **Create Integration Tests**
   - Test layer interactions
   - Validate CLI commands
   - Verify agent orchestration

The architectural foundation is now in place. Once Weaver is installed, the project can achieve its full potential for semantic convention → code generation.
