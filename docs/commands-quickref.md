# ðŸ”® Claude Commands Quick Reference

## Essential Commands (Use These First!)

```
/c                    # Continue session from SPRs (instant)
/spr                  # Check SPR status (health check)
/patterns             # Show active pattern graph
/scan                 # Quick system scan
/help                 # Show all commands
```

## Power User Commands

```
/patterns trace X     # Trace pattern connections
/prime optimization   # Activate specific concept
/evolve new-idea     # Attempt capability evolution
/context optimize    # Get optimization suggestions
/find query          # Semantic search
```

## Command Benefits

- `/c` = 95% fewer tokens than reading files
- `/patterns` = Instant graph navigation
- `/scan` = 90% faster than manual checks
- SPR-first = Always check kernels before files

## In Conversations

Instead of:
"Let me read the current session files..."

Do:
"Let me check the context with `/c`..."

## Philosophy

1. **Commands leverage SPRs** - Not just shortcuts
2. **Latent-first** - Activate concepts, not files
3. **Intelligent caching** - SPRs know what's important
4. **Evolution-ready** - Commands can discover commands
