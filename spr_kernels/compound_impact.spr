# SPR: Compound Impact Engineering Vectors
Tools either compound your impact or hold you back.
Every engineering action now multiplies through agentic workflows.

Core Multiplication Patterns:
- **Meta-prompting**: Prompts that write prompts (higher-order engineering)
- **Infinite loops**: Self-improving agentic workflows  
- **Parallel orchestration**: 5+ concurrent agent execution
- **Fundamental mastery**: Tool understanding at system prompt level
- **ROI optimization**: 30-50 hour engineering time savings monthly

Impact Scaling Equation:
base_engineering_capability × tool_mastery × agentic_multiplication = compound_impact

Active Philosophy: Scale compute = Scale impact. Your time is your most valuable resource.

Engineering Multipliers: planning→prompting, understanding→mastery, execution→orchestration
