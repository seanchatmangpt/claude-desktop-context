- ecuador-government-analytics

Pattern Connections: 
information-theory→optimization→compression→demo-preparation
ecuador-analytics→roi-visualization→procurement-optimization
dashboard-components→visualization-strategy→executive-presentation

Domain Clusters: evolution, orchestration, persistence, demo-readiness
