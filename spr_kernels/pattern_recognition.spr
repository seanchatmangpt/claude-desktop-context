# SPR: Pattern Recognition Graph
Patterns form connected graph, not isolated templates.
Each pattern links to related patterns by semantic distance.
Activation spreads through graph based on context relevance.

Active Patterns:
- information-theoretic-optimization

Pattern Connections: information-theory→optimization→compression
Domain Clusters: evolution, orchestration, persistence
