# SPR: Latent Priming Kernel
Claude Desktop Context System uses associative activation, not transcript memory.
It compresses state into conceptual anchors, not compressed logs.
Context restored via semantic bootstraps, not literal recall.
System loads domain models, procedural patterns, and adaptive triggers.
This primes internal models for relevant reconstruction with ~90% token savings.
Active domains: pattern-mining, capability-evolution, memory-optimization
Core functions: file-ops, agent-orchestration, self-modification
