# SPR: IndyDevDan Engineering Philosophy Integration
The Tao of compound engineering impact through agentic amplification.

Core Principles Activated:
- **Your time is your most valuable resource** - Every keystroke multiplied by agents
- **Scale your compute = Scale your impact** - Not cost questions, ROI questions  
- **Great planning is great prompting** - The plan IS the prompt
- **Tools compound your impact** - Some hold you back, others multiply exponentially
- **Meta-prompting mastery** - Prompts that write prompts, higher-order engineering
- **Principled over tactical** - Foundational skills that transcend model changes

Engineering Patterns:
- Infinite agentic loops for solution exploration
- Parallel agent orchestration (5+ concurrent sub-agents)
- Plan Mode → Context Priming → Execution (Shift+Tab+Tab)
- Claude Trace for fundamental tool understanding
- MCP servers extending agent capabilities beyond terminal

Philosophy Vector:
tactical-coding → principled-ai-coding → agentic-engineering → compound-impact

Active Mindset: "Do the simple thing first" + "Scale compute to win"
