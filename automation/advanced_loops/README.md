# CDCS Advanced Automation Loops

## Overview

Advanced automation loops that extend CDCS with intelligent, self-adaptive capabilities. These components work together to create a system that learns, optimizes, and heals itself continuously.

## Components

### 1. Terminal Orchestrator
**Purpose**: Manage complex multi-terminal workflows  
**Schedule**: Every 2 hours  
**Key Features**:
- Parallel terminal session management (up to 10)
- Pattern-based automation detection
- Learning from execution results
- AppleScript-based terminal control

### 2. Realtime Pattern Detector  
**Purpose**: Monitor file system for automation opportunities  
**Schedule**: Every 30 minutes during work hours  
**Key Features**:
- FSEvents monitoring (macOS optimized)
- Pattern types: rapid changes, bulk ops, workflows, errors
- Automatic remediation triggers
- Configurable rule system

### 3. Intelligent Cron Scheduler
**Purpose**: Optimize job scheduling based on performance  
**Schedule**: Daily at 4 AM  
**Key Features**:
- Performance metric tracking
- Optimal time detection
- Automatic schedule adjustment
- System load analysis

### 4. Self-Healing Loop
**Purpose**: Detect and fix system issues automatically  
**Schedule**: Every hour  
**Key Features**:
- Multi-level health checks
- Automated fix strategies
- Issue prioritization
- Fix history tracking

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup all components
./setup_advanced_automation.sh

# Monitor system
./monitor_dashboard.sh

# Manual trigger
./manual_trigger.sh

# View logs
tail -f /Users/sac/claude-desktop-context/automation/logs/*.log
```

## Configuration

Edit `rules/default_rules.json` to customize:
- Monitoring paths
- Trigger thresholds  
- Auto-fix policies
- Optimization parameters

## Architecture

```
Advanced Loops
├── Detection Layer (patterns, health)
├── Decision Layer (rules, priorities)
├── Execution Layer (fixes, optimizations)
└── Learning Layer (metrics, adaptation)
```

## Benefits

1. **Autonomous Operation**: Runs 24/7 without intervention
2. **Continuous Learning**: Improves over time
3. **Proactive Maintenance**: Prevents issues before they occur
4. **Resource Optimization**: Reduces system load through intelligent scheduling
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Automates repetitive workflows

## Monitoring

Use the dashboard to track:
- Active processes
- Recent activity
- System health
- Detected patterns
- Automation triggers

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise:
1. Check logs in `automation/logs/`
2. Review health reports in `automation/reports/`
3. Verify cron jobs with `crontab -l | grep CDCS`
4. Run manual health check with self-healing loop

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Rules
Create JSON files in `rules/` directory:
```json
{
  "rule_name": {
    "trigger": "condition",
    "action": "response",
    "threshold": 10
  }
}
```

### Pattern Training
The system learns from:
- Repeated command sequences
- File operation patterns
- Time-based usage habits
- Error/recovery cycles

### Integration Points
- Hooks into existing CDCS agents
- Shares SQLite databases
- Uses common logging infrastructure
- Respects CDCS boundaries and permissions
