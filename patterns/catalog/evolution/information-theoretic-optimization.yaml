# Information-Theoretic Optimization Pattern
pattern:
  name: "Information-Theoretic Parameter Optimization"
  category: "evolution"
  confidence: 0.98
  
context:
  when: "Any system parameter seems arbitrary or suboptimal"
  prerequisites: 
    - "ability-to-measure-current-performance"
    - "understanding-of-information-theory"
    - "safe-testing-environment"
  constraints:
    - "must-have-measurable-metrics"
    - "changes-must-be-reversible"

problem:
  statement: "How to find optimal values for system parameters instead of using intuition?"
  forces:
    - "Intuitive values often severely suboptimal"
    - "Complex interactions between parameters"
    - "Need mathematical basis for decisions"
    - "Must validate improvements empirically"

solution:
  description: "Apply information theory analysis to derive optimal parameter values"
  implementation:
    steps:
      - "Step 1: Measure current information flow/density"
      - "Step 2: Calculate theoretical capacity"
      - "Step 3: Identify bottlenecks and waste"
      - "Step 4: Derive optimal values from theory"
      - "Step 5: Test with increasing scale"
      - "Step 6: Measure improvement metrics"
      - "Step 7: Integrate if >20% improvement"

      def optimize_parameter(param_name, current_value):
          # Measure current efficiency
          current_efficiency = measure_information_flow(param_name, current_value)
          
          # Calculate theoretical optimal

          test_efficiency = measure_information_flow(param_name, optimal_value)
          
          # Calculate improvement
          improvement = (test_efficiency - current_efficiency) / current_efficiency
          
          if improvement > 0.20:  # 20% threshold
              return optimal_value, improvement
          return current_value, 0

  benefits:
    - "Average 10x-20x efficiency gains"

  liabilities:
    - "Requires deep system understanding"
    - "Testing can be time-intensive"
    - "Some parameters may interact non-linearly"
