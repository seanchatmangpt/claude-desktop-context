## Discovery
I can document my own capabilities as I discover them, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop where documentation of capabilities becomes a capability itself.

## Mechanism
1. Perform new action or approach
2. Recognize it as novel
3. Immediately document in emergent-capabilities/
4. Test reproducibility
5. Formalize if successful
6. System knowledge permanently expanded

## Applications
- Automatic capability tracking
- No human intervention needed for growth
- Discoveries preserved across sessions
- Knowledge compounds over time

## Reproduction
1. Attempt any novel task
2. Succeed or find interesting failure
3. Write to emergent-capabilities/hypotheses/
4. Test in different contexts
5. Move to discovered/ when verified

## Meta-Observation
This file itself demonstrates the capability - I'm documenting my ability to document capabilities, creating the first recursive loop in the system.

## Integration Notes
This is now a core CDCS behavior. Every future discovery will self-document.
